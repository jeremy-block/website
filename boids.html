			<p>In this game, you play as a colony of tadpoles in a tidepool. There also happen to be other creatures swimming about, and by using your <strong>mouse cursor</strong> you can try to avoid them. </p>
			<p>You can also sit back and watch the simulation take place too. The basic flocking inteligence does a pretty cool job on it's own!</p>
			<p>While in reality flocks do no have a leader, I thought adding some interaction with the simulation would make it more engaging.</p>
			<p>In reality <strong>All</strong> flocks, with any form of complex "inteligence," rely on the compund use of simple rules. Every agent in a Complex Adaptive System folows a set of rules that create the intrcate patterns we see in the wild. In the same way, A foundation of simple rules brings the AI of this game come to life.</p> <img src="img/anemoni.jpg" width="100%" /> </div>
